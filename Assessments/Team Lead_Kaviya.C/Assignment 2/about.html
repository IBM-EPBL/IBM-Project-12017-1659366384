			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p class="text">
			From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelter’s web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact person should be responsible for direct communications with Petfinder. Petfinder is made up of animal-care professionals and regular people volunteering for their local animal welfare organizations all working together to maintain active and accurate homeless pet lists. Most animal welfare volunteers have “real jobs” by day. The success and the magnitude of this project is largely due to their tireless efforts to make a difference.
